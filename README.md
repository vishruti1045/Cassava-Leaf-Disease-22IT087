# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Detection-22IT087

**Introduction:**

Cassava, the second-largest source of carbohydrates in Africa, is a vital crop for food security, especially among smallholder farmers. Grown by at least 80% of household farms across Sub-Saharan Africa, this resilient starchy root thrives in harsh conditions. However, cassava production faces significant challenges due to viral diseases that severely impact crop yields. Traditionally, disease detection has relied on the expertise of government-funded agricultural specialists who manually inspect and diagnose the plants. This approach, while valuable, is labor-intensive, limited in supply, and costly.

Given the widespread cultivation of cassava and the resource constraints faced by many farmers—such as access only to mobile-quality cameras and low-bandwidth internet—there is a pressing need for innovative solutions that can accurately identify common diseases in cassava leaves. Leveraging data science and machine learning, we can develop a cassava leaf disease detection model that empowers farmers with a tool to diagnose diseases efficiently and cost-effectively, ultimately improving crop yields and enhancing food security across the region.
